# Twooter - The place for twoots!

This is a simple twitter-esque app created for a code test. The main purpose of this app is to show my competency working with React + Redux.

## Stuff used

- react
- redux react-redux redux-thunk
- emotion
- material-ui
- moment
- Seinfeld quotes via https://seinfeld-quotes.herokuapp.com/

## Backlog / enhancements

If I were to maintain this app there are a few things I'd like to add and/or improve upon:

- Character limit and proper validation on new twoots
- Replace placeholder data with redux store data
- Breaking the Seinfeld quote fetch into multiple actions to create a smoother experience in cases where the API is slow to respond
- Do some destructuring on components to make it easier to read and determine what props are being used
